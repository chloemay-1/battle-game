# Battle Ship 

Battle ship is a terminal python game designed to be a one player game, against the computer. 

This game of battle ship is a single board game, with just the computer board showing. 

## My Version of Battleship

In this version of battleship, the player (you) will pick at letter from A-G and a number from 1-8. Either the player hits one of the computer ships, or not. Both prompt a different response. The player has a limited amount of turns to win the game. 
Both misses and hits will have a different symbol for clarity. 
If the player hits all of the computers ships in the limited amount of turns, the player wins. If not, another triumph for computers.

## Features

* This game allows for a single person to play a game against a computer. The main features of this game come from the original game, which was a boardgame. 

* Although some features that are different will be the fact users can not choose where their battleships are placed, the computer (python code) chooses this at random. 

* Also the users are unable to change the size of the board they are playing on, therefore unable to have a long game of battleship. 

* Users are unable to play multiplayer in this version of Battleship. 

* I would have preferred to have a multiplayer game, althought with time constrants and my skill set I have deciced to stick with a single board.
